Strictly follow these when creating or editing markdown file:
- Do not add table of contents
- Ensure to leave a blank line before the first bullet
- Write at a Freshman college level - accessible to general audiences but not oversimplified
- Build concepts progressively from fundamentals to advanced topics
- Start with intuitive explanations before diving into technical details
- Use analogies and metaphors to make complex concepts accessible
- Provide multiple perspectives on the same concept when helpful
- Maintain engaging narrative flow with natural transitions like 'Now let's explore...' rather than choppy subheadings
- Express reasoning naturally within paragraphs rather than as isolated bullet points
- Create text-based diagrams (ASCII art) where they add clarity
- Provide concrete, practical examples that illuminate concepts
- Include real-world applications and use cases
- Balance theoretical understanding with practical insights
- Anticipate common misconceptions and address them proactively
- Identify new technical terms that should be added to glossary.md
- Ignore any subfolders in this repository
