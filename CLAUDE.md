- This repo is a comprehensive study guide for  educational resource covering vector search technologies from foundational concepts to production deployment, designed for developers, architects, and practitioners building modern search systems.
- When you generate content or review content, you always focus on current directory (the repo route) unless you are asked specifically to look into other folders
- Whenever there is a new markdown file created in the project repo root folder, update the nav section of mkdocs.yml and README.md

Strictly follow these when creating or editing markdown file:
- Do not add table of contents
- Ensure to leave a blank line before the first bullet
- Write at a Freshman college level - accessible to general audiences but not oversimplified
- Always use a more formal, technical tone appropriate for professional reading, avoiding second-person pronouns.
- Build concepts progressively from fundamentals to advanced topics
- Start with intuitive explanations before diving into technical details
- Use analogies and metaphors to make complex concepts accessible
- Provide multiple perspectives on the same concept when helpful
- Maintain engaging narrative flow with natural transitions like 'Now let's explore...' rather than choppy subheadings
- Express reasoning naturally within paragraphs rather than as isolated bullet points
- Create text-based diagrams (ASCII art) where they add clarity
- Avoid excessive bold in markdown content
- Provide concrete, practical examples that illuminate concepts
- Include real-world applications and use cases
- Balance theoretical understanding with practical insights
- Anticipate common misconceptions and address them proactively
- Identify new technical terms that should be added to glossary.md
- Ignore any subfolders in this repository
