#### Serverless Performance Characteristics

**OpenSearch Compute Units (OCUs) Explained:**

OpenSearch Compute Units (OCUs) are the fundamental scaling unit for Serverless collections. Each OCU provides a fixed amount of compute and memory resources that automatically scale based on your workload demands. Understanding OCU characteristics is essential for capacity planning and cost optimization.

**OCU Specifications:**

**OCU Requirements Estimation:**

Accurate OCU estimation requires analyzing both memory requirements for vector storage and compute requirements for query processing. The estimation process involves calculating storage needs, overhead factors, and performance targets to determine optimal OCU allocation.

**Memory-Based Calculation:**
- **Vector storage**: Calculate memory needed for raw vector data (4 bytes × dimensions × vector count)
- **[HNSW](glossary.md#hnsw-hierarchical-navigable-small-world) overhead**: Add approximately 150% overhead for graph structures
- **Total memory requirement**: Sum vector storage and HNSW overhead
- **Required OCUs**: Divide total memory by 6GB per OCU

**Compute-Based Calculation:**
- **Query throughput**: Estimate ~50 queries per second per OCU for vector search (illustrative)
- **Required OCUs**: Divide target QPS by per-OCU capacity
- **Final requirement**: Use the maximum of memory-based or compute-based OCU count

**OCU Allocation Strategy:**
- **Indexing OCUs**: Handle data ingestion and index building operations
- **Search OCUs**: Handle query processing (typically 50% of indexing OCUs)
- **Minimum allocation**: At least 2 search OCUs for high availability

**Example OCU Estimation:**
For 1M vectors (384 dimensions) targeting 100 QPS:
- **Vector memory**: ~1.4GB for raw vectors
- **Total with overhead**: ~3.5GB including [HNSW](glossary.md#hnsw-hierarchical-navigable-small-world) structures
- **Memory-based OCUs**: 1 OCU (6GB capacity)
- **Compute-based OCUs**: 2 OCUs (100 QPS ÷ 50 QPS/OCU)
- **Recommendation**: 2 indexing OCUs, 2 search OCUs
- **Estimated cost**: ~$350/month (illustrative, verify current pricing)

**CloudWatch-Based Auto-Scaling Strategy:**

CloudWatch provides comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities that enable intelligent auto-scaling decisions. By leveraging multiple metrics and sophisticated policies, you can create responsive scaling that maintains performance while optimizing costs.

**Core Scaling Policies:**

Effective auto-scaling relies on well-tuned policies that respond to capacity pressure without causing oscillations. Core policies should address memory pressure, query performance, and resource utilization with appropriate cooldown periods to ensure stability.

**Scale-Up Triggers:**
- **JVM Memory Pressure**: Threshold at 80% utilization
- **Evaluation period**: 2 consecutive periods of 5 minutes each

- **Off-heap usage**: 60% available for vector storage and graph structures
- **Optimal for**: Primarily vector search applications with minimal text processing

**Mixed Workloads:**
- **Heap allocation**: 50% of total node memory
- **Rationale**: Balanced approach for text and vector processing
- **Off-heap usage**: 50% for vector data, sufficient heap for text operations
- **Optimal for**: Applications combining traditional search with vector capabilities

**Text-Heavy Workloads:**
- **Heap allocation**: 60% of total node memory
- **Rationale**: Text processing requires more heap memory for indexing and querying
- **Off-heap usage**: 40% available for limited vector operations
- **Optimal for**: Traditional text search with occasional vector queries

**JVM Configuration Best Practices:**

**Garbage Collection Settings:**

- **Network breaker**: `network.breaker.inflight_requests.limit: 100%`
- **Real memory usage**: `indices.breaker.total.use_real_memory: true`

**Monitoring and Alerting:**
- **Circuit breaker trips**: Monitor frequency and patterns of breaker activation
- **Memory pressure**: Track heap utilization approaching breaker thresholds
- **Query patterns**: Identify queries consistently triggering breakers
- **Performance impact**: Monitor latency increases when breakers are active

### Security and Access Control

#### Comprehensive IAM Configuration

**Production IAM Roles:**

Production IAM roles should follow the principle of least privilege, with clearly defined responsibilities and scope limitations. Each role serves specific functions in the production environment with appropriate security boundaries.

**IAM Role Configuration Guidelines:**

IAM role configuration requires careful consideration of access patterns, security requirements, and operational needs. Proper role design enables secure automation while maintaining necessary access controls for different user types and system components.

**Application Service Role:**

- **Integration permissions**: Access to Bedrock for embedding generation (Titan models)

**Administration Role:**
- **Purpose**: Infrastructure management and cluster operations
- **Permissions**: Full OpenSearch domain management capabilities
- **Scope**: Domain creation, deletion, configuration management
- **Usage**: DevOps teams, automated deployment pipelines
- **Restriction**: Separate from application roles for security isolation

**Read-Only Analyst Role:**
- **Purpose**: Business intelligence and monitoring access
- **Permissions**: Read-only access to OpenSearch data
- **Scope**: Limited to specific analysis and reporting needs

**Field-Level Security Implementation:**

Field-level security enables granular control over data access, allowing different users and applications to access subsets of document fields based on their roles and requirements. This capability is essential for multi-tenant applications and compliance scenarios.
**PII Protection Strategy:**
- **Access pattern**: Grant access to content and vectors while protecting sensitive fields
- **Allowed fields**: `title`, `content`, `content_vector` for search functionality
- **Restricted fields**: `user_email`, `user_ip`, `sensitive_metadata` for privacy protection
- **Use case**: Multi-tenant applications requiring data privacy compliance

**Security Best Practices:**
- **Principle of least privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions for each role

#### Network Security Configuration

**VPC and Security Group Setup:**

**Network Security Configuration Strategy:**

Network security forms the foundation of OpenSearch cluster protection, requiring careful design of VPC architecture, security groups, and access controls. A well-designed network security strategy provides defense in depth while enabling necessary connectivity for applications and management.
**VPC Architecture Design:**
**Multi-AZ Private Subnet Strategy:**
- **Data node subnets**: Deploy across multiple AZs (e.g., us-west-2a, us-west-2b)
- **Master node subnet**: Separate subnet for dedicated master nodes (e.g., us-west-2c)
- **CIDR allocation**: Use non-overlapping ranges (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24, 10.0.3.0/24)
- **Purpose isolation**: Dedicated subnets for different node types and functions

**OpenSearch Cluster Security Group:**

- **Principle of least privilege**: Minimal required connectivity only
- **Monitoring access**: CloudWatch and other AWS service endpoints

**Web Application Firewall (WAF) Protection:**

AWS WAF provides application-layer protection against common web exploits and abuse patterns. For OpenSearch deployments, WAF rules should focus on protecting API endpoints from malicious queries, rate limiting, and geographic restrictions based on business requirements.

**Rate Limiting Rules:**
- **Request throttling**: Limit to 1000 requests per 5-minute window per IP
