### ⚡ Quick Overview
*Brief introduction to vector search*

**What is vector search?** A method that enables computers to understand meaning rather than just matching exact words, powering modern AI applications like semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

**Why does it matter?** Vector search enables:
- **Semantic understanding**: Find "car repair" when searching for "automobile maintenance"
- **Cross-modal search**: Find images using text descriptions
- **AI-powered applications**: ChatGPT-style systems with external knowledge

**How does it work?** Convert text, images, or other data into mathematical vectors (embeddings) that capture meaning, then use specialized algorithms to find similar content based on geometric proximity in high-dimensional space.

**🔍 Key Innovation**: [Embeddings](glossary.md#embedding) - dense vector representations that preserve semantic relationships as geometric distances.

**📈 Real-world impact**:
- **Semantic Search**: Google's understanding of search intent
- **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix, Spotify content discovery
- **RAG Systems**: ChatGPT with external knowledge
- **E-commerce**: Visual and semantic product search
